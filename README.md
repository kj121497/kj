# A Heuristic Evaluation of Instagram and Snapchat

### DH 150 Assignment 1 by Kimberly Jimenez

###### The reason I choose Instagram and Snpachat, to heuristically evaluate, is because I spend a lot of my recreational time on both of these apps which double as online communities. Online communities, as a whole, connect users together from around the world, including long and short distances. Whereas Snapchat is meant for a more private form of communication, both Snapchat and Instagram create friendships and relationships through mutual interests.

Instagram is a social media site used for photo and video sharing and networking with other users. Captions tend to accompany photo and video posts, but users have the choice to the use the option to their discretion, whether brief, long, or blank. Instagram is known for connecting celebrities to their fans, connecting friends and family, used to engage with and share artwork, travels, concerts, and other similar experiences. Furthermore, the app can be used to connect with people in real-time (Instagram Live) or a brief 24 hour recap (Instagram Story).

A first glance view at Instagram proves the app has the basic funcitionalities of a working app. There are five icons at the bottom of the app which allows users to navigate the app. Posting several photos and videos without having to clutter a profile allows for an aesthetically pleasing feed and profile. Aside from the Heart and Paper Airplane icon, the Home, Search, Add, and Profile icons are easy to understand and hints to where the icon may lead a user. However, the Heart icon leads to Acivity, which is not immediately understood by simply looking at the icon. Moreover, the Paper Airplane icon leads to direct messages between users, the two have no immediate correlation. The app no longer informs users how many likes a post has received, which can experience, enjoyment, and validation. The app makes it diffucult for a user to access the posts they have liked. Links that are unnecessarily repetitive—"Close Friends"—could make space for useful features, such as "Posts You've Liked". These are only some of the user issues immediately found. To summarize, the app is functional, but needs work.

### Information About Snapchat

Snapchat is a multimedia messaging app, used to communicate with friends and family. Messages, Snaps, and Stories are meant to last no longer than 24 hours. Users can communicate one-on-one or in group chats. It is a fast and easy way to communicate daily and current updates of an individual's life and experiences, without the permeance of other social media or messaging sites. It allows users to connect with celebrities, who can choose to post updates of their daily life. Users can suscribe to different types of channels, whether they be informational or for entertainment. Also, Snapchat allows users to track their friends through the Map, which gives them location whereabouts. 

A first glance view at Snapchat proves the app, like Instagram, equips the basic functionalities of a working app. There are four landing pages in total—Snapchat Messages, Camera, Stories and Subscriptions, and Shows. The layout is simple and easy to navigate with the swipe of a finger. However, there are issues that need to be dealt within the landing pages and the experience of the app itself. On Snapchat Messages, there is no way to erase old chats, which is inconvenient for users who no longer message each other. On Camera, simply touching the screen activates Snapchat's filters, even though there is already an icon for them to appear. Shows is a repetitive landing page and mimics the "For You" under Stories and Subscriptions. These are only some of the user issues immediately found. To summarize, the app is functional, but needs work.

### Visibility of System Status

##### Instagram:

Instagram does not inform users or track how many Likes a post has received—whether that be their post or from someone they follow. If users want to know how many Likes a post has received, they have to manually count them, which can become absurd with posts that receive millions of Likes. This is a recent update; it has negatively impacted users who use Instagram for advertising and sponsorships. Furthermore, it affects users on a personal level, who receive validation from the people liking their posts. Instagram has stated they want their users to focus on sharing, rather than Likes; however, they still inform users how many Comments a post has received, which is a contradiction to their refusal to provides users with statitcal information about Likes. (3)

Users are unable to rewind, forward, pause, or play videos. Videos play automatically and continue until they are finished only for them to loop again. Instagram provides a brief time marker in the beginning of the video to indicate how long it is, but it disappears soon after (approximately 3 seconds in) and the user is left to wonder how much time there is left. (3)

##### Snapchat:

Subscriptions on Snapchat, when viewing and swiping through the Story of that particular channel, have no indicator to let users know how far along they are into the Story or even how long the Story is to begin with. Netflix has an indicator on "Continue Watching" which I think could be useful for Subscriptions, Stories, Channels, etc. (1)

### Match Between System and the Real World

##### Instagram:

As previously mentioned in the evaluation, a Heart icon at the bottom of the screen stands for a user’s Activity. However, the correlation between a heart and activity can be hard to decipher. While users do see posts they have liked and likes they have been given, they are also informed of comments, tagged posts, new followers, and other user’s activity. I would recommend a icon resembling a line chart for activity. (1)

##### Snapchat:

Snapchat includes a Bitmoji on the top left corner of the screen which presumably stands for profile, it does; however, it is also the only way to access another icon—a Gear, fitting—to reach user Settings. (1)

---
### User Control and Freedom

##### Instagram:

When uploading and sharing photos onto a profile, they must adhere to a certain size limit Instagram has put into place, otherwise images will be awkwardly cropped no matter how hard a user tries to fit the entirety of their image. Thus, users are forced to crop their images, even though they may not want to. (3)

##### Snapchat:

Currently, there is no option to change a username. Once a user has chosen their username, they must adhere to it or make an entirely new account. The lack of freedom prevents users from completely enjoying their experience on the app should they want a new username for privacy or personal reasons. (3)

---
### Consistency and Standards

##### Instagram:

As previously mentioned in the evaluation, the Heart icon can be confused for “Posts You’ve Liked”, which is a feed of all the posts a user has liked. I believe “Post You’ve Liked” should become it’s own featured, where it is more prominent and less likely to be confused with the Heart icon that stands for Activity. (2)

Currently, there is too much consistency in how frequent an unnecessary feature appears. The feature “Close Friends” appears twice, whereas “Post You’ve Liked” (a feature that enhances a user’s experience only appears once). I believe making room for useful features would be helpful for user experience. (2)

There is a separate tab under the Three Lines icon that reads “Activity”—it shows a user how much time they spend on Instagram—which is different to the Heart icon navigation page that is also labeled “Activity”. (2) 

##### Snapchat:

The Three Dot icon in the Discover page alludes to user Settings; however, it is actually a feature for users to “Manage Subscriptions and Notifications”, “Select Interests”, and “View Hidden Stories”. I would suggest changing the icon so as to not allude to user Settings. (1)

### Error Prevention 

##### Instagram:

There is no pause between viewing Stories on Instagram. After one has finished, the next one will continue, even if a user had no intention to watch it. Having the option to play a Story one by one would be useful for users who want to avoid watching a particular person’s Story. (2)

##### Snapchat:

Focusing the camera by tapping on the screen brings up Snapchat’s filters and may create frustration and confusion when attempting to take a fast or elegant picture. Hitting a filter after it has been brought up is too prone for error. Focusing the camera should not mean a user wants to use filters, as well. (3)

---
### Recognition Rather than Recall

##### Instagram:

Currently, users have to memorize the pathway to “Posts You’ve Liked” if they want to access the feature. First, users must click the Threw Line Icon, then they click Settings, then Account, then “Post You’ve Liked”. There are three barriers preventing a user from accessing this feature. Making it more accessible would be useful for users who want to see their interests. (3)

##### Snapchat:

The Search engine on the Camera and Discover page is not as intuitive as the Search Engine labeled “Find Friends” even though they achieve the same job. Users have to recall it is not a random Search engine and is used to find their friends. (1)

---
### Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

##### Instagram:

Posting is relatively easy, for experienced and inexperienced users. Clicking on the Add icon will immediately take a user to their camera gallery for them to pick and choose their selected images. Furthermore, if the image is not already enhanced or edited, Instagram provides a quick method for inexperienced users to freshen their image and a quick solution for experienced users who do not have the time to edit their images. (Good)

##### Snapchat:

Accessing the four navigation pages is relatively easy—there is no need to click, simply swiping will do the job. For experienced users, this is a fast way to move around Snapchat, and for inexperienced users, it is great for their curiosity to learn about the app. (Good)

---
### Aesthetic and Minimalist Design 

##### Instagram:

Although the Plus icon on the profile picture on profile page is useful for a quick change, it clutters the vision of the image. Furthermore, there is already an option to do so under “Edit Profile”. I believe removing it would appeal to an aesthetic and minimalist design. (1)

##### Snapchat:

The “For You” under Discover is essentially the same features as the fourth page on Snapchat, which is Shows. Removing either, or at the very least minimizing how clunky the “For You” can be when there is already a page that elaborates upon it, would make for an aesthetic and minimalist design. (1)

---
### Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

##### Instagram:

Although Instagram includes an Help page, I believe making it more accessible would be more helpful for users who are just learning how to use the app. Currently, a user must go to their Profile, then click the Three Line icon, then Settings, then the Help page. I believe the pathway to achieve Help is too long. Placing the Help page under the Three Line icon would enhance a user’s experience. (2)

##### Snapchat:

Recently, when uploading Stories with a poor connection, Snapchat will recognize a Story has been uploaded, but refuse to post it when a user has a better connection. Clicking “Retry” is an option, but sometimes even “Retry” will refuse to work and the Story is stuck there unless a user deletes it. Solving this problem and providing a concrete solution for users is important. (3)

---
### Help and Documentation

##### Instagram:

The Help Center under Help leads to an entirely separate website from Instagram, which can still be accessed from Instagram, because the app supports browsers. Accessing help through the app is important, because the user is not forced to take extra steps, such as visiting a different browser altogether, to receive solutions. The documenentation for help is useful—detailed and explanatory—for inexperienced and experienced users alike. The design of the website could be more graphically pleasing, but it is simple and easy to navigate. (Good)

##### Snapchat:

The Support page under Settings, too, leads to an entirely seperate website from Snapchat, which can still be accessed through the app, as it supports browsers. Being able to access everything through the app is important for user experience, the user does not have to take any extra steps to receive help. The design of the website is graphically pleasing and visually easy to navigate. The documentation for help is useful for inexperienced and experienced users, who might need help recovering Snap Streaks or steps toward changing their password. (Good)
