# A Heuristic Evaluation of Instagram and Snapchat

### DGT 150 Assignment 1 by Kimberly Jimenez

###### The reason I choose Instagram and Snpachat, to heuristically evaluate, is because I spend a lot of my recreational time on both of these apps which double as online communities. Online communities, as a whole, connect users together from around the world, including long and short distances. Whereas Snapchat is meant for a more private form of communication, both Snapchat and Instagram create friendships and relationships through mutual interests.

Instagram is a social media site used for photo and video sharing and networking with other users. Captions tend to accompany photo and video posts, but users have the choice to the use the option to their discretion, whether brief, long, or blank. Instagram is known for connecting celebrities to their fans, connecting friends and family, used to engage with and share artwork, travels, concerts, and other similar experiences. Furthermore, the app can be used to connect with people in real-time (Instagram Live) or a brief 24 hour recap (Instagram Story).

A first glance view at Instagram proves the app has the basic funcitionalities of a working app. There are five icons at the bottom of the app which allows users to navigate the app. Posting several photos and videos without having to clutter a profile allows for an aesthetically pleasing feed and profile. Aside from the Heart and Paper Airplane icon, the Home, Search, Add, and Profile icons are easy to understand and hints to where the icon may lead a user. However, the Heart icon leads to Acivity, which is not immediately understood by simply looking at the icon. Moreover, the Paper Airplane icon leads to direct messages between users, the two have no immediate correlation. The app no longer informs users how many likes a post has received, which can experience, enjoyment, and validation. The app makes it diffucult for a user to access the posts they have liked. Links that are unnecessarily repetitive—"Close Friends—could make space for useful features, such as "Posts You've Liked". These are only some of the user issues immediately found. To summarize, the app is functional, but needs work.

Snapchat is a multimedia messaging app, used to communicate with friends and family. Messages, Snaps, and Stories are meant to last no longer than 24 hours. Users can communicate one-on-one or in group chats. It is a fast and easy way to communicate daily and current updates of an individual's life and experiences, without the permeance of other social media or messaging sites. It allows users to connect with celebrities, who can choose to post updates of their daily life. Users can suscribe to different types of channels, whether they be informational or for entertainment. Also, Snapchat allows users to track their friends through the Map, which gives them location whereabouts. 

A first glance view at Snapchat proves the app, like Instagram, equips the basic functionalities of a working app. There are four landing pages in total—Snapchat Messages, Camera, Stories and Subscriptions, and Shows. The layout is simple and easy to navigate with the swipe of a finger. However, there are issues that need to be dealt within the landing pages and the experience of the app itself. On Snapchat Messages, there is no way to erase old chats, which is inconvenient for users who no longer message each other. On Camera, simply touching the screen activates Snapchat's filters, even though there is already an icon for them to appear. Shows is a repetitive landing page and mimics the "For You" under Stories and Subscriptions. These are only some of the user issues immediately found. To summarize, the app is functional, but needs work.

5. Error prevention 
	Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. 

Evaluation

6. Recognition rather than recall 
	Make objects, actions, and options visible. 
	User should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. 
	Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. 

Evaluation

7. Flexibility and efficiency of use 
	Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user so that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. 
	Allow users to tailor frequent actions. 

Evaluation

8. Aesthetic and minimalist design 
	Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. 
	Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. 

Evaluation

9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors 
	Expressed in plain language (no codes)
	Precisely indicate the problem
	Constructively suggest a solution.

10. Help and documentation 
	Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. 
	Help  information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.
